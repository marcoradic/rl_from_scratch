## About

A selection of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms, mostly tabular methods or environments from OpenAIs `gym` environment.

Implemented techniques include:

- Q-Learning
- Sarsa
- n-step Sarsa
- Q(Î»)
- Eligibility Traces
- Value Iteration

Function approximation / Deep Q-Learning coming soon.

## Dependencies
Using Python 3:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
