# rl_from_scratch
Selected Reinforcement Learning algorithms, implemented in Python

## About

A collection of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms, mostly tabular methods or games such as Blackjack from OpenAIs `gym` environment.

These are just examples that do not provide modularity or clean interfaces :hammer:, implemented for educational purposes :mortar_board:.

Implemented techniques include:

- Q-Learning
- Sarsa
- n-step Sarsa
- Q(Î»)
- Value Iteration

Function approximation / Deep Q-Learning coming soon.

## Dependencies
Using Python 3

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
